# DATA-ANALYST-PORTFOLIO
Hi , My name is Tinapat Oumleang (Cornae) 26 year old. I am currently pusing a Master's degree in Data science and Analyst at
" King MongKut's of Technology Ladkrabang".
Although I do not yet have direct working experience as a Data Analyst, I am highly passionate about the field. I started self-learning and later joined the Data Rockie Bootcamp, where I built a strong foundation in SQL, Python, and Power BI. I have also completed several online courses from DataCamp and W3Schools to further strengthen my skills.

Previously, I worked in Logistics (Inbound Process), where I gained experience in Import & Export process.
