## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

### 1. KPIs
```sql
-- Total Revenue
SELECT SUM("Unit_price" * "Quantity") AS Total_Revenue
FROM "SuperMarketAnalysis";

-- Average Order Value
SELECT SUM("Unit_price" * "Quantity") / COUNT(DISTINCT "Invoice_ID") AS Avg_Order_Value
FROM "SuperMarketAnalysis";

-- Average Items per Order
SELECT SUM("Quantity") * 1.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT "Invoice_ID") AS Avg_Items_per_Order
FROM "SuperMarketAnalysis";
```
###  2. Product Analysis
```sql
-- Top 5 Product Lines by Revenue
SELECT "Product_line" ,
		SUM ("total_sale") as "Total_Revenue"
FROM "SuperMarketAnalysis"
GROUP by "Product_line"
ORDER by "Total_Revenue" DESC
LIMIT 5 

-- Bottom 5 Product Lines by Revenue
SELECT "Product_line" ,
		SUM ("total_sale") as "Total_Revenue"
FROM "SuperMarketAnalysis"
GROUP by "Product_line"
ORDER by "Total_Revenue" ASC
LIMIT 5 

-- Top 5 Branches by Sales

GROUP by "City"
ORDER by "Total_Revenue" DESC
